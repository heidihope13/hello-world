Getting started with Responsive Web Development
I am a graphic Designer trying to learn some new coding skills so that I can design and then code responsive website structures going forward. My other interests include pottery, camping and sailing, although I don't own or know anyone local who owns a sailboat. I live with my boyfriend in Beverly Ma.
